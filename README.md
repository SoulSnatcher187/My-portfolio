Few steps to run the project locally:
 -In terminal
1. run "npm i"
2. run "npm start" to start the project

I used free trial version of SVG Logo (self-drawing and 3d animations API).
Because of that I post it without the logo, but I will drop pictures down below.
Ofcourse, you can view it when you run the project locally.

Feel free to send me an email! :)
